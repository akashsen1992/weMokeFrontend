                    Originally commissioned for the British military in the late 1950s, these doorless vehicles turned out to be less than suitable for warfare. Luckily, they caught on with the public, who fell in love with the “Mini Moke.” It helped that the Moke was created by Sir Alec Issigonis, the father of the original Austin Mini, who was an expert on marketing niche cars. It wasn’t too long before the Moke was embraced by celebrities like Brigitte Bardot, Jackie O and the Beach Boys. Even 007 got in on the action in four James Bond movies: Live and Let Die, You Only Live Twice, Moonraker and The Spy Who Loved Me. Surfers and tourists also enjoyed cruising around destinations like Hawaii, St. Barts, Macau, Mauritius and Barbados in the little Moke.
